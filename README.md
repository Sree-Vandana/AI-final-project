# AI-final-project

## Project Topic/Goals
We are going to solve the 2048 game using different AI algorithms and going to compare the performance of each algorithm.
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. And we will try to achieve this using AI algorithms.
